# biodiversity_project
For this project, we will analyze data from the National Park Service regarding endangered species across various parks.

Our focus will be on exploring the conservation statuses of these species, identifying potential patterns or trends that may explain why certain species become endangered. Throughout the project, we will clean and analyze the data, visualize key insights, and formulate and answer questions in a meaningful way.
